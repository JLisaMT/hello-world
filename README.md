# hello-world
I'm just getting to know GitHub and its' functionality.
I'm actually a music therapist by profession, but I am also very interested in open education, online learning, online education and open source software.
I'm hoping that by getting onto GitHub, I can learn what to do when I download an piece of open-source software that is non self-extracting.
Basically, I want to know enough to be dangerous and seriously disrupt my computer.
I've also played around with Moodle for several years, and would like to understand what is happening with tools such as MAMP and the "update.moodle" link.
